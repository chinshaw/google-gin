This directory contains Java source files for the parts of the Guice API
that the GWT compiler needs to see when using GIN. Mostly this consists
of interfaces and annotations copied directly from the Guice code base.
In a few instances, we provide API-compatible stubs since the code will
not in fact be exercised in GWT client code. The stubs allow GinModule
code to compile via the GWT compiler.

This subtree is never compiled via javac (see the excludes in build.xml).
The source files are packaged with GIN to be made available to the GWT
compiler. It is critical that these are never javac'd, or else they
might interfere with the real Guice types on the classpath of GIN's
Generator.
