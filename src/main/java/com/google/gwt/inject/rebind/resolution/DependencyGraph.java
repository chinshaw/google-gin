/**
 * A graph of the dependency information between types that need to be injected
 * at a given injector, called the origin.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link DependencyGraph} consists of a set of dependencies linking
 * dependency nodes (keys). Each edge explains how a particular node came to be
 * required: for instance, a key may be required in the {@code @Inject}
 * constructor of a class, or it might be required by the Ginjector. There are
 * two kinds of dependency nodes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Pre-existing dependency nodes contain a {@link Key} and a
 * {@link GinjectorBindings}. They represent keys that are already available on
 * some Ginjector in the hierarchy and visible to the origin.</li>
 * <li>Internal dependency nodes represent bindings that are not already
 * created/available, but that can have implicit bindings created for them. They
 * contain the {@link Key} that the binding is for and the {@link Binding} that
 * can be created.</li>
 * <li>In addition, some nodes may represent errors. These contain a {@link Key}
 * and a {@link String} describing the error. These nodes are created for keys
 * that do not already exist and for which we cannot create an implicit binding.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
